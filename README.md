This repository is my neural network playground.
<br>I keep checking in notebooks which I have worked on my neural-network learning journey. Please free to e-mail me on tarunjain07@gmail.com for any question, improvement or correction in any notebook.
<br><br>I hope you get what you're looking for :v: :innocent:.

I'm listing all the checked-in notebooks with brief description

#### 1. [Backpropagation basics](Backpropagation.ipynb)
TODO  - Basic notes to revise/understand backprop.<br>

#### 2. [Decimal to Binary conversion using Neural Network](Decimal_to_Binary_Using_Neural_Net.ipynb)
This is the solution to one of the exercise from Michael Nielsen's book - Neural Networks and Deep Learning.<br>
Link to exercise - http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html#exercise_513527

#### 2. [AND and OR gate using Perceptron algorithm](AND_OR_Perceptron.ipynb)

Implemented AND gate and OR gate using perceptron. In this notebook, during training process, **perceptron learns appropriate weights** to correctly implement AND and OR gate.

> Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.<br> Perceptron is usually used to classify the data into two parts. Therefore, it is also known as a Linear Binary Classifier

#### 3. [Implemented Autoencoder using CNN](Autoencoder_using_Convolutional.ipynb)
#### 4. [Implemented Autoencoder using Multi-layerd Perceptron](Autoencoder_using_MLP.ipynb)
#### 5. [Edge detection using filters](Edge_Detection.ipynb)
#### 6. [High pass filter](High_pass_filter.ipynb)
<br>
